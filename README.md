# Puzzler

As part of my coursework with Udacity, I designed tested and iterated on a
mobile VR expirience called Puazzler. In this game, players enter a gloomy
dungeon with surreal looking orbs, and are asked to solve a puzzle similar
to a simon says to move on.

## Process Section

# Statement of Purpose:




# Persona

for this reason I created a user persona called Bob. Bob is a x year old gamer
and has minimal expirience with VR. Bob likes playing gemas, but doesn't
allweay get the time he needs to play them. He spend most of this gaming time
on theh commute to work. He likes to solve puzzels.
