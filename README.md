# Miha's Puzzler Project

As part of my coursework with Udacity, I designed tested and iterated on a
mobile VR expirience called Puazzler. In this cgme, players enter agloomy
dungeion with surreal looking orbs, and are asked to solvbe a puszzle similar
to a 3d simon says to move on.

## Unique Consideratiosn

There were many interisteng design considerations during this project , but the
most notable wasa the need to design a spacd so theat users could intuitively
understand the objective of the game in a simple mobile experince.

# Puzzler

I part of my course with Udacity, I designed tested and iterated on the mobile
VR expirence called Puzzler. 



This projejc was a huge success thanks to the carful iterative appproach that
was used to consistently improve the game. People have had a ton of fun trying
out BR and plahing this game, and everyon intuitvle understand how to interact
with the space.

# Statement of Purpose:




# Persona

for this reason I created a user persona called Bob. Bob is a x year old gamer
and has minimal expirience with VR. Bob likes playing gemas, but doesn't
allweay get the time he needs to play them. He spend most of this gaming time
on theh commute to work. He likes to solve puzzels.
